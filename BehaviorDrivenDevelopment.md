# Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

## What it is?
A software development methodology that extends Test Driven Development (TDD). The goal of BDD is to improve communication between all stakeholders by using natural language to define the behavior of the software. IN BDD we should write tests in a way that describes the system’s behavior from the user’s perspective.

## Process
BDD follows a cycle similar to TDD, but it focuses on writing behavior scenarios in plain language. The process includes:

- **Given**: Describes the initial context or state of the system.
- **When**: Defines the action or event that triggers the behavior.
- **Then**: Specifies the expected outcome or result of the action.

This format allows for writing clear and concise scenarios that everyone involved in the project can understand, ensuring alignment between technical and non-technical team members.

### Example:
- **Given** a user is logged in...
- **When** the user clicks on the "profile" button...
- **Then** the user should see their personal information displayed.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced collaboration**: BDD encourages clear communication among developers, testers, and non-technical stakeholders, helping ensure that the software meets the business requirements.
  
- **User-centric approach**: The scenarios are written in a way that describes the software from the user's perspective, ensuring the development team focuses on delivering the most relevant features.

- **Clearer specifications**: Since BDD scenarios are written in natural language, they act as living documentation that is easily understandable by both technical and non-technical people.

- **Faster feedback**: By using tools that automate BDD tests, feedback on the system’s behavior is immediate, enabling teams to quickly identify problems and fix them.

- **Better maintainability**: The clear and descriptive nature of BDD scenarios makes the code easier to maintain, as the requirements and behaviors are well-documented and understood.
